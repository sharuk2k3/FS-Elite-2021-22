A Builder builds a wall in a strange way.
The wall has to built with a width of W.
And there are N building-blocks are available with some width and height.

The wall is built as follows:
	- Pick the first few buiding-blocks and place them in the available 
	width of the wall.
	- Once no more buildin block in the order can't be kept in the available 
	width of the wall, 
	place a concrete rack on the highest building-block among the row of 
	building blocks.
	- Construct the rest of the wall by repeating above two steps until
	all the blocks used.

Your task is to find and return the minimum possible height of the wall built 
with width W, after using all N building blocks.
